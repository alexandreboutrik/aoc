This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles.

Each year is organized into its own subdirectory with its own specific build system and language choices.

| Year | Language | Focus/Tools | Location |
|:-:|:-:|:-|:-:|
| 2025 | <img width="16px" src="./.media/ada.png"> SPARK / Ada | Formal verification using `gnatprove`. | ./aoc\_2025 |

Please refer to the README.md within each specific year's directory for detailed build and run instructions.
